# Day-1

part-1 seems simple read the file as string and convert it into array and use reduce to calculate floor

part-2 tried solving with reduce but at last found findIndex method there may be more clean solution for this need to check 

# Day-2

part-1 solved with reading file as string and split into array and use reduce,need to check for any other clean solution for solving this

part-2 confused to min min1,min2 for some time but at last solved it,need to check any other way of solving by checking reddit

I guess sort will eliminate if else logic after seeing reddit solutions but array.sort() is somewhat weird.I will try to use sort and improve solution

# Day-3

After reading question,I didnt get idea how to solve but after seeing some blog posts and discussing with a friend,found out we shoula use x,,y coordinates and Sets(to not add duplicates)

part2 was also same thing just we have to alternate between input using index by using % 2
